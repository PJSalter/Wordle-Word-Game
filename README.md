# Wordle-Word-Game Take Home Project :sparkles:

### A challenge from [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) to complete a feature that was based on the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) which is a huge trend these days :star:

### Assigning an issue to this Repository that identifies the feature I am creating from the User story. 

### I will implement issue #1 Create a grid layout - this will include:
- #### a flex layout centred for responsiveness.
- #### these squares will have diameters to fit each letter typed by user.
- #### five columns and six rows.
- #### each square tile will have a grey boarder identifying each individual square.

## User Story

- ### A daily game that has a new word each day.
- ### User will have six attempts from a five letter word to guess what this word is
- ### Every time you guess a word incorrect the user will get some hints.
- ### Contains settings for hard mode
- ### yellow tiled colour letters guessed mean the letter exsists in the word but it's not in the correct position.
- ### if the letter is green tiled then this means it's the correct position.
- ### grey tiled means that the letter isn't even displayed within the word at all.
- ### after six tries and user is still incorrect then the game will tell the user the correct word.
- ### contains a feature where the user may click on a link to see instructions. Closing these instructions back to the game once finished reading.
- ### link to pop up statistics to user may determine how many wins and games played.
- ### randomising feature so that once quess is typed for letter then it'll choose and display from users decision.
- ### each letter will be based in square grid layout.
- ### submit enter button functionality. 
- ### feedback if correct.
- ### return function to start again.

# Accessibility:

- ### There is a color blind mode and dark mode within the settings (correct contrast ratio for colours).
- ### mobile touch screen recognisable.
- ### screen reader for visisally impaired users.
- ### page scroll up and down with keyboard.
